## Prerequisites:

Ensure you have an up-to-date version of Python 3, as well as the PIP package manager.

Install all of the necessary dependencies by opening a terminal window from the root directory of this project and running the following:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Depending on the IDE you are using and the Python environment you have set up, you might be shown errors when trying to acquire these dependencies. In this case, you might have to install some dependencies manually.

## Project Configuration:

All project settings can be found at the top of the 'src/app.py' file, alongside a description of what each setting will do.

## Project Execution

**PLEASE NAVIGATE INSIDE OF THE 'SRC' FOLDER BEFORE RUNNING THE SERVER** - There are some relative file paths used and Python will likely complain about not finding files if you try and start from outwith this folder.

Once inside of the 'src/' folder, run the following:

```sh
python3 app.py
```

Any potential errors should he handled and displayed in the terminal window.
